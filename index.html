    <main>
        <div class="divs">
            <p>Bhavnagar is a city and the headquarters of Bhavnagar district in the Indian state of Gujarat. It was
                founded in 1723 by Bhavsinhji Gohil. It was the capital of Bhavnagar State, which was a princely
                state before it was merged into the Indian Union in February 1948.
                Bhavnagar is situated 190 kilometres away from the state capital Gandhinagar and to the west of the
                Gulf of Khambhat. It has always been an important city for trade with many large and small scale
                industries along with the world's largest ship breaking yard, Alang which is located 50 kilometres
                away. Bhavnagar is also famous for its version of the popular Gujarati snack 'Ganthiya' and
                'Jalebi'.</p>

    <h1>History Of Bhavnagar</h1>
    <div class="divs">
        <p>Bhavnagar State Thakur of Bhavnagar in the 1870s The Gohil Rajput of the Suryavanshi clan faced severe
            competition in Marwar. Around 1260 AD, they moved down to the Gujarat's coastal area and established three
            capitals: Sejakpur (now Ranpur), Umrala, and Sihor.Sejakpur was founded in 1194.

            In 1722-1723, the forces led by Khanthaji Kadani and Maratha Pilaji Gaekwad attempted to raid Sihor but were
            repelled by Maharajah Bhavsinhji Gohil. After the war, Bhavsinhji realized the reason for repeated attacks
            was
            the location of Sihor. In 1723, he established a new capital near Vadva village, 20 km away from Sihor, and
            named it Bhavnagar after himself. It was a carefully chosen and strategic location because of its potential
            for
            maritime trade. Naturally, Bhavnagar became the capital of Bhavnagar State. In 1807, Bhavnagar State became
            a
            British protectorate.</p>
